# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate a machine learning model for credit risk assessment using historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. We aim to develop a model that can accurately predict the creditworthiness of borrowers, helping the company make informed decisions about loan approvals and minimizing the risk of default.

## Results
- **Accuracy Score**: 
- **Precision Score**: 
- **Recall Score**: 

## Summary
The logistic regression model performed reasonably well in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans, with [insert accuracy, precision, and recall scores]. Based on these results, we recommend using the model for credit risk assessment. However, further evaluation and refinement may be necessary to improve its performance and reliability.
